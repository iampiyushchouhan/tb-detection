# TB Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

A deep learning project that detects tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as:
- **Normal**: Healthy chest X-ray
- **TB**: Tuberculosis affected chest X-ray

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN architecture optimized for medical image analysis
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit app for image upload and prediction
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 85-95% accuracy on test data
- **Real-time Prediction**: Fast analysis of uploaded X-ray images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **OpenCV**: Image processing
- **NumPy, Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization
